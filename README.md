# dtrg-education-module  

## Objective  
The Dialog-to-Resume Generator (dtrg) is designed to facilitate
human-like converstion between a human and the system. Based on the responses from the
user, the system learns new facts about the user and stores it to eventually be turned into
a resume for the user.

Our resume will be focused for a web developer position and will have the following main sections:  
1. Resume Objective
2. Name & Contact Info: this will be typed in by the user rather than collected via conversation
3. Skills
4. Education (The focus of this module)
5. Projects

Under the Education section of the resume, these are the areas of interest:
* Highest Education Level: if university, also degrees earned
* Year education accolade achieved
* Special Certifications earned by the user

Starter Questions:
* Do you have any academic degrees/What academic degrees have you attained?
    * In what field?
    * When did you get your {degree}?\ What year did you get the degree?
    * What type of Degree\To confirm: was the degree a BSc.
